# __Bash files__
This repo includes some bash files to simplify tasks
1) __Commit script__ (`commit.sh`)
This file simplifies the commit task. First uses `git add .` then it prompts a menu with some commit options which you can edit (`FIX`, `UPDATE`, `LINT`) and then asks you for a commit message. Finally commits the changes with a message like this: `[UPDATE] added select input in component`.
